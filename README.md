# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It was developed as part of my internship at Codsoft to learn GUI development and game logic handling in Python.

## Overview

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game allows players to compete against the computer in a series of rounds. Each round, the player selects one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its option, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

The game continues until the player chooses to exit.

## Features

- **GUI with Tkinter:** Provides an intuitive and interactive interface for playing the game.
- **Game Logic:** Implements the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors to determine the winner of each round.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's score across multiple rounds.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that the player selects a valid option (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Exit Option:** Allows the player to exit the game at any time.
